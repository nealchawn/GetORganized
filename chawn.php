 <p class="about-text"><strong>I'm a fourth year student at SUNY POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY</strong> in New York studying computer science and interaction design. I have experience developing and implementing algorithms and desgins for web pages, web applications, desktop applications and android applications. I work to create code that serves the goals of the intended user(s) of the application whether it requires exstensive backend work or a simple and friend design that is easy to navigate.</p> 

 <p class="about-text">I love creating code from scratch as well as working with pre-existing projects to solve issues. I have great pride in my ability to make code independent to the language I am currently using when possible.I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. My main goal is to become the best and most versitile problem solver I can be.</p> 

 <p class="about-text"><strong>When I'm not working on the computer,</strong> I'm most likely tutoring, traveling, meeting new peoples and cultures, or learning a new skill.</p>
